Entities of unparalleled power and ability from beyond our reality, a "pantheon" is the best way to refer to the group as a whole. Let go of your definition of any 'god' or mighty being ruling the universe, the pantheon are for all intents and purposes the supreme beings. Many cults have spawned over human history worshipping these mostly forgotten beings, however [HARKI](/wiki/articles/factions/harki) is the longest lasting of the bunch (though rarely accepting humans into its ranks). The small time cults are either doomsday or want to gain some favor with these outer gods, and it only sometimes works.

The pantheon have taken on what could best be described as "family relations", each member makes up a classical human family member like "father" or "niece". [Seraph](/wiki/articles/characters/pantheon/seraph) said it was "simply for fun".
## ORIGINS
Good luck ever finding one, [Seraph](/wiki/articles/characters/pantheon/seraph) wouldn't even give a straight answer. (note to future Fischer, ask Difer if she could force an answer out)

| Outer God | Refers to the powerful entities outside of reality mentioned above.                                                                                                 |
| Pantheon  | "all the gods of a people or religion collectively" is the dictionary definition, however in this instance it is more accurately just a grouping of the outer gods. |
