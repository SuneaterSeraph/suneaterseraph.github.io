CARPO is currently a contracted sub-division of the FBI, founded in 1873 to deal with the "Bloodbath of Arkaria". Currently they are specialized in containing and restricting supernatural / paranormal activity. They develop technology surrounding Objects and are pioneers in the hunt for the same.

## ORIGINS

CARPO's origins are to be found deep within the American plains. Founded in 1873 as an emergency program to contain and study an event by the assigned name of: "Bloodbath of Arkaria".

Known as the first country-wide exposure to the supernatural nature of objects and beings. The Bloodbath of Arkaria changed the perception of the government, who  never before acknowledged the existence of something beyond, turning their interest and most of their investments towards this new science. The events nestled in the forbidden files of its situation tell a deep forgotten story. Luckily, the Facility has been able to recover certain fragments of this valued treasure.

It is recommended that all of out employees understand these events, although optional in its contents, this account is considered extremely important for those that wish to endear themselves to our cause.

### THE BLOODBATH OF ARKARIA
Arkaria was a town in the inner borders of Utah, its exact location is unknown, for all that is left from the once sprawling streets and residences is redacted or currently fenced off. 

In the year 1873, on the month of February a strange event started to take shape in the lovely town. After the events of light seismic activity waves residents on the Casarolla neighborhood described these happenings:

**20TH OF FEBRUARY**

- At 21:02 A blood curdling scream could be heard from the house of the Johanna family.
- At 21:14 A young child, runs out of the front door. Behind it, a figure of unknown origin snatches the child and vanishes into the backyard of the Smiths. 

ADDENDUM: The figure could not be identified by the witnesses. But the child was reported to be Elisa Johanna.

Elisa Johanna was never found.

- At 22:46 The figure (previously seen snatching Elisa Johanna) breaks through the windows of the Smith's household. It runs away from the home as Mr. Smith shoots it.
- At 22:48 The figure screams (witnesses recount that this scream was similar to the first scream, heard at 21:02)
- At 22:52 Another figure appears from the Anderson's household. Both of the figures embracing and shaking violently. 
- At 22:53 Both of the figures start to combust and expand in a mass of flesh. The smell is similar to pork. 
- At 22:59 The neighborhood is evacuated, casualties number at 5 confirmed deaths and 12 speculative deaths or considered a missing person.

On multiple neighborhoods similar events occur, multiple of these figures are seen prouncing and stalking farms, churches and different public spaces during the previous days. 

**DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES:**

Pale and blemished, hairless and quadrupedal. The creatures looked similar to horses, but instead of a head, they had a mass of limbs. Such limbs varied from figure to figure. 

Some presented multiple hands, claws or other undescriptive limbs protruding from the mass. The way they moved was similar to skittering and days before they could be seen stalking livestock in the fields. 

A total of 3 figures where able to be contained by the civilian population. All the ones that interacted with the figures would soon disappear in a couple of days. All of them seemed to be afflicted by
