# Universal Systems
Here is a description of the inner-workings of the universe.
## Magic
Coming from the same place [Seraph](/articles/characters/main/seraph) says to be from, the "void" beyond reality, magic in our universe isn't about fireballs or raising the dead (though, the second one is possible). Manipulating this force requires knowledge and concentration, one misstep or saying the wrong thing will wreck havoc on your body. Humans have no true reason to meddle in these affairs.

[HARKI](/articles/factions/harki) is considered to be at the center of the "magical community", both in the lead for research, and housing the largest amount of magical beings.
