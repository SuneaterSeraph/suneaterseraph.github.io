# SILAS GROVES
<span class="version">2.4.1</span><span class="faction">UNALIGNED</span> 

Son of John Groves, Silas came into Facility attention when he attempted to invade us for the purpose of killing [Seraph](/wiki/articles/characters/pantheon/seraph). This of course failed. While he appears to be a man of faith, Silas has used less-than-holy enhancements to his armor and weaponry.
## APPEARANCE
The only recorded instance of Silas, he wore a gilded set of full plate armor made of an unknown metal, along with a sword that had red cracks in it.
## ORIGIN
Silas, upon turning 6, started to be raised by a single mother. The two were heavily involved in church, turning to it in desperate times and for a sense of community. Years later, and Silas is noted to have become a "monster hunter" of sorts.
## PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT
Mr. Groves seems steady in his religious faith, to a zealot extent. His revenge-fueled journey to the Antarctic was driven by his late father's passing.
## ALIASES
