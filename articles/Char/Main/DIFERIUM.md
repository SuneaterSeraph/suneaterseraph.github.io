# DIFERIUM
<span class="version">8.0.3</span> 

A robot sent from the future to stop Earthâ€™s sun from disappearing. Difer founded the facility in the Antarctic dedicated to this cause.
## APPEARANCE
Over the years since the creation of the IFD, Difer has created various different frames all with their own unique appearances. One thing is always the same however, a large pink gem resides around where the heart would be, modeled after her core that is in the deep reaches of the facility.

## ORIGIN

## PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT
Difer is a very hopeful robot, practically emanating it from her metal. This doesn't come without worries however, she often wonders if she will ever truly be able to save the sun, or if the process was doomed from the beginning.
