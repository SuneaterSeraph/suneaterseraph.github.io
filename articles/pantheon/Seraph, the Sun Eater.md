# SERAPH, THE SUN EATER
<span class="version">0.2.7</span><span class="faction">PANTHEON</span><span class="faction">HARKI</span> 

An entity claiming to be from "the void", Seraph has an unknown level of power and ability over reality (theorized to be limitless, untested). The being was bound to [Difer](/wiki/articles/characters/main/difer) after the robot performed a ritual. Seraph herself claims that no one, in the history of living, has managed to bind an outer god so perfectly.

Report any supernatural happening to the nearest [Difer](/wiki/articles/characters/main/difer) frame. Either they were caused by Seraph, or she will be instructed to stop whatever is.</p>

## APPEARANCE
Seraph usually stands around 6ft 5inches (1.95m) with little to no color spread across that height. Notable features include: glowing blue eyes,  an unknown liquid draining from the bottom of the eyes, glossy horns protruding from the top of the forehead, various tattoos scattered around the body (one large one on the back identified as the binding sigil), and a gradient on each finger similar to the liquid from her eyes, but dirty in appearance. Black wings have occasionally been seen from her back, and her horns seem to grow during what Seraph refers to as "the thrill of the hunt".

Other forms have been noted, including a black cat, and a crow.

Origin related to facility relationship would be [Difer](/wiki/articles/characters/main/difer) binding of the creature. A true origin is currently unknown.
