# SINH, THE UNIVERSE INCARNATE
<span class="version"> Version 0.0.1</span><span class="faction">PANTHEON</span>

Another member of [Seraph](/wiki/articles/characters/pantheon/seraph)'s family, and just as powerful. What knowledge we have comes from old (potentially outdated) books, and [Seraph](/wiki/articles/characters/pantheon/seraph) herself. She says that Sinh "is the universe itself" and that "each of the outer gods tend to be connected to various ideas and archetypes". The validity of these quotes is shaky at best, and older texts describe Sinh as "all encompassing", perhaps leading to the idea that they aren't the universe, but inhabit all of it. Whichever it is, Sinh is not a force to reckon against.
## APPEARANCE
Sinh is made of the same black liquid as [Seraph](/wiki/articles/characters/pantheon/seraph) while manifesting inside reality, however they congeal around scraps of metal to make up a humanoid body.

## ORIGIN
Similar to [Seraph](/wiki/articles/characters/pantheon/seraph), no true origin is known. Best guess, they both came from the same place.
## PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORT
Once again, [Seraph](/wiki/articles/characters/pantheon/seraph) is our only account, and she has described Sinh as "silly".
## ALIASES
